April 6th 2021

David Atherton was assigned the issue.
Varun Reddy helped with pair programming.

David implemented the aspect where drones and robots drop their packages
when they run out of battery. Varun was watching over David coding and helped
by bringing up ideas for implementation and catching errors. Varun Reddy 
on April 14th later caught an error and fixed it.
