# My solution to Assignment 2
Possible errors: 
PDB API call fail when running the program instance after calling cmake .. to fix this run the program again and it should work.

Bugs:
The ball gets stuck to the car sometimes when there are a lot of collision, just reset the ball using space.

Cannot get the car to do a full 360 turn. However, the car does go forward and backward with some acceleration.

Implemented every other feature except the turning for the car.
