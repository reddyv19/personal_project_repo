Purpose of program: The purpose of this program is to simulate a shell similar to the linux terminal. The program has capabilities for cd, ls, wc, pipes,
and file redirection.

Compilation: Change directory in terminal to the Template directory. Run "make clean; make" in terminal.
Run "./shell" to run shell in which you can run command through typing said commands into the terminal. Run "./cd <recursive_flag>" to run cd. Run "./wc <format_flag> <filename>" to run wc. Run "./ls" to run ls.

Execution: When executed, the program alerts the user that they are now using a separate shell than the linux terminal. The user may then use commands similar
to a linux terminal such as cd, ls, wc, pipes, and file redirections. The user may also enter "exit" in order to leave the program's shell and return to the linux terminal.

Assumption: User can compile C code. 

Contributions: This project was mainly done doing peer programming most of was done together over a Discord call.
